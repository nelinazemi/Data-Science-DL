#### Welcome to my repo containing data science projects on various topics, showcasing knowledge in Deep Learning and the ability to apply it to real-world complex models.

## Projects:
- ### 1- [Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Classification:](https://github.com/nelinazemi/Data-Science-DL/tree/f29a2b9145ae41fcc3aa59e89c7f866f4b3fa7a8/Multilayer%20Perceptron%20(MLP)%20Implementation/MLP%20for%20Classification)
    - This project focuses on predicting the price range of mobile phones based on various features using a neural network model.
    - A MLP model is defined with two hidden layers. The model is moved to a GPU if available.
    - The model is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer and Cross-Entropy Loss as the loss function.
    - The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set.survived or not based on the given features with a high degree of accuracy.
    - 
- ### 2- [Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Regression:](https://github.com/nelinazemi/Data-Science-DL/tree/f29a2b9145ae41fcc3aa59e89c7f866f4b3fa7a8/Multilayer%20Perceptron%20(MLP)%20Implementation/MLP%20for%20Regression)
  - This project focuses on predicting the median house value based on various features using a neural network model.
  - The model is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. The training process involves calculating the loss for each batch of data and updating the model parameters.
  - The model's predictions on the test set are compared with the actual values to compute the R-squared score.
